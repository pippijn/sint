# Sinterklaas FTL - The "Perfect Start" Strategy

This document outlines a verified strategy to defeat the first boss ("The Petty Thief") and enter the mid-game with **16/20 Hull Integrity** and **Zero Active Hazards**. This foundation is critical for surviving the marathon against the remaining three bosses.

## Core Principles

1.  **Hull is Life:** Never trade Hull for Damage. If a room is on fire, extinguishing it is a higher priority than shooting the boss.
2.  **Evasion is King:** Blocking an attack prevents both Hull damage AND fire spawns. Player 3 (P3) must prioritize `Evasive Maneuvers` (Bridge) every round the enemy attacks.
3.  **Clean Ship:** Do not let fires linger. Fires spread and multiply damage.
4.  **Efficient Logistics:** Player 1 (P1) is the ammo factory. P2 is the courier. P5/P6 are the turrets. Do not waste AP moving P5/P6 to fetch ammo; bring it to them.
5.  **Event Management:** Solve AP-draining events (`Listing Ship`, `Overheating`) immediately. Delay damage-dealing events (`Weird Gifts`) only if Hull is high and board is clear.

## Squad Roles

*   **P1 (The Baker):** Operates the Kitchen (5). Bakes peppernuts and stockpiles them in the Hallway (0) for others to grab.
*   **P2 (The Troubleshooter):** The most mobile unit. Hangs out in Hallway (0). Relays ammo from P1 to Gunners. Runs to Cargo (3) or Bridge (7) to solve events or extinguish fires that P3/P4 can't reach.
*   **P3 (The Pilot):** Camps in the Bridge (7). Spams `Evasive Maneuvers` (2 AP) to block attacks. Only moves to extinguish local fires or if `Panic!` forces relocation.
*   **P4 (The Engineer):** Camps near the Engine (4). Primary responsibility is solving Engine-based events (`Turbo Mode`, `Overheating`, `Listing Ship`) and extinguishing Engine fires.
*   **P5 & P6 (The Gunners):** Camp in the Cannons (6). Their job is to convert AP into damage. They should rarely move; ammo should be thrown to them.

## Phase 1 Walkthrough (Rounds 1-10)

### Setup (Round 1) - "Ride the Lightning"
*   **Goal:** **EXPLOIT Turbo Mode.** Do NOT solve it. We want the +1 AP per player for 3 rounds (Total +18 AP).
*   **Strategy (Assuming Start in Dormitory - Room 2):**
    *   **P1 (Baker):** Move to Kitchen (5). Path: 2->0->5 (2 AP). Bake (1 AP). Total 3 AP. (Result: 3 Peppernuts on Kitchen Floor).
    *   **P2 (Courier):** Move to Kitchen (5). Path: 2->0->5 (2 AP). PickUp (1 AP). Total 3 AP. (Result: P2 holding 1 Peppernut in Kitchen).
    *   **P3 (Pilot):** Move to Bridge (7). Path: 2->0->7 (2 AP). 1 AP Saved.
    *   **P4 (Engineer):** Move to Engine (4). Path: 2->0->4 (2 AP). 1 AP Saved (Grab Extinguisher if needed/possible).
    *   **P5/P6 (Gunners):** Move to Cannons (6). Path: 2->0->6 (2 AP). 1 AP Saved.

### Stabilization (Rounds 2-3)
*   **Event:** `Sugar Rush` (Free Moves, NO SHOOTING). Combine this with Turbo Mode (3 AP) for massive mobility.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **P1:** Bake nonstop.
    *   **P2:** Ferry ammo to Cannons. **DO NOT SHOOT** (Sugar Rush forbids it). Stockpile ammo at Cannons.
    *   **P3:** Evasive Maneuvers (if needed).
    *   **P5/P6:** Reposition to Cannons. **DO NOT SHOOT**. Use free moves to help transport items if needed.
    *   **Preparation for BOOM (Round 3):** P4 must end Round 3 in the Engine (4). P2 should be nearby (Hallway/Cargo) to assist.
    *   **Round 4 (The Clean Up):** **CHECK FOR FIRES.** The Engine usually catches fire here (Turbo Mode end). **IF** there is fire, P4 and P2 extinguish it immediately. If not, prep for next round.

### The Grind (Rounds 4-7)
*   **Status:** Check Enemy HP. Boss might already be dead or half-dead due to Turbo AP.
*   **Events:** `Rudderless`, `No Light`, `Fog Bank` (Likely).
*   **Strategy:**
    *   **IF** `No Light` is active: P2 solves it in Cargo.
    *   **IF** `Rudderless` is active: P4 solves it in Bridge (if needed) or P3 handles it.
    *   P3 continues Evasion.
    *   **Critical:** In Round 7 (`Panic!`), everyone is displaced to Dormitory. Use the remaining AP to rush back to stations. P3 likely fails to Evasive here, taking 1 hit.

### The Counter-Attack (Rounds 8-9)
*   **Event:** `Listing Ship` (Actions cost 2 AP).
*   **Critical Play (Round 8):** P4 solves `Listing Ship` immediately. P2 (from Hallway) rushes to Bridge to Extinguish the fire from Round 7, freeing P3 to use `Evasive Maneuvers`.
*   **The Volley:** P5 and P6 pick up ammo stockpiled by P1/Rain. They unleash a barrage in Round 8 and 9.
*   **Result:** Boss 1 defeated.

### Transition (Round 10)
*   **Goal:** Prepare for Boss 2 ("The Monster").
*   **Actions:** Extinguish any remaining fires (e.g., from `Short Circuit`). P2 solves `Weird Gifts` early to prevent a future boom. P1 bakes a fresh batch of ammo.

## Managing Phase 2 (The Monster) & Beyond

*   **Boss 2 (10 HP):** Requires sustained fire. P1 must Bake/Pass constantly. P2 acts as the dedicated ammo runner.
*   **Hull Management:** You start with ~16 Hull. You can afford to tank ~1 hit per 3-4 rounds, but fire control remains priority #1.
*   **AP Economy:** If `Overheating` returns, P4 must solve it or abandon Engine. If `Listing Ship` returns, solving it is top priority.
